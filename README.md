# Goal

Build and app widget, plugin that has SDK which allows user to link web2 to web3. We serve a system which user can pay his/her subscripton fees as crypto or fiat which is available on owners’ wallet.

This open source SDK we have developed is encrypted with ZeroKnowledge and makes it different with its tooling features.

Owner can manage the subscriptons order date/time and upgrade it thanks to Smart/Proxy Upgradable contracts.

We aim other developers comfortability on using the plugin which means **developer-friendliness.**
